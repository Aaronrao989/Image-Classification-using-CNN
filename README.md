# Image-Classification-using-CNN
This project is a simple image classification web app built using Streamlit and a TensorFlow/Keras model. It allows users to upload an image, processes it using Pillow, and predicts the class using a pre-trained model. The project demonstrates the integration of a deep learning model with an interactive web UI for quick and easy deployment.
